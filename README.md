# Artificial Neural Network

**from cmd** 
# Installing Keras
# pip install --upgrade keras


I Used libraries like Numpy for math ,Pandas for along an axis of the DataFrame , matplotlib for creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels and Finally seaborn for making statistical graphics in Python , scikit learn and keras 

Keras : The Keras Python library makes creating deep learning models fast and easy.

Requirements : python7.3
